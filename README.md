This is the code for my [fully automated M&M candy launcher.](https://youtu.be/hsGhCl0y1FY) I apologize in advance for my sloppy and uncommented code.

You can find some of the 3d printed parts I designed for my machine in the STLs folder. Take note that this folder does not contain all of the 3d printed parts you need to build your own M&M shooter, just the majority of the key components. I'd also like to mention that if you plan on printing the penny sled, I made the holes slightly too small. You can either open them up with a large drill bit, or use an STL modifying software such as [Meshmixer](http://www.meshmixer.com) to make the holes large enough to fit the pennies.
